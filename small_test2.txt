"George, I would like you to look at the nursery."
"What is wrong with it?"
"I dont know."
"Well then."
“I just want you to look at this, that’s all, or call a psychologist to
look at it."
"What would a psychologist want with a nursery?"
“You know very well what he wants.” His wife stopped in the middle of the kitchen and watched as the stove was busy buzzing, cooking dinner for four.
“It's just that the nursery is now different from what it was.”
"Okay, let's see."
They walked down the hallway of their house with soundproofing Happylife, which cost them thirty thousand dollars. This house dressed, fed and rocked them to sleep, play and sing, and it was good for them. As they approached, a switch appeared somewhere, and the nursery light came on when they were ten feet away. Likewise, behind them, in the halls, the lights turned on and off when they left them behind, with a soft machine gun.
“Good,” said George Hadley.
They stood on the straw floor of the nursery. It was forty feet wide and forty feet long and thirty feet high; it cost twice as much as the rest of the house. “But there is nothing good for our children,” said George.
They were silent in the nursery. On a hot afternoon it was empty, like a clearing of the jungle. The walls were empty and two-dimensional. Now that George and Lydia Hadley were standing in the center of the room, the walls began to purr and retreat to a crystalline distance, it seemed, and now there was an African veld, in three dimensions, on all sides, in color reproduced before the finale. pebbles and a bit of straw. The ceiling above them turned into a deep sky with a hot yellow sun. George Hadley felt sweat begin to beat on his forehead.
“Let's get out of this sun,” he said.
“This is too real. But I don’t see anything wrong with that. ”
“Wait, you'll see,” his wife said.
Now a hidden smell began to blow with the smell of the wind in two people in the middle of a burnt valley. The hot straw smell of lion grass, the cool green smell of a hidden watering hole, the strong rusty smell of animals, the smell of dust, like red paprika in hot air. And now it sounds: the sound of distant antelopes on grassy turf, the paper rustling of vultures. A shadow passed through the sky. A shadow reflected on George Hadley's upturned, sweaty face.
“Dirty creatures,” he heard his wife.
"Vultures."
“You see, there are lions, much further, like that. Now they are on their way to the water pit. They just ate, ”Lydia said. "I do not know what".
"Some animal." George Hadley raised his hand to shield the burning light from his narrowed eyes. "A zebra or a little giraffe, maybe."
"Are you sure?" His wife sounded especially tense.
“No, it's a little late to be sure,” he said in surprise. "I see nothing there, except for the cleaned bone, and the vultures run away to what is left."
"Have you stood that scream?" she asked.
"No"
"About a minute ago?"
"Sorry but no."
The lions were walking. Again, George Hadley was full of admiration for the mechanical genius who conceived this room. The miracle of sales efficiency at an absurdly low price. Each house should have one. Oh, sometimes they scared you with their clinical accuracy, they scared you, they gave you an injection, but most of the time it was funny for everyone, not only for your own son and daughter, but for yourself, when you felt like someone else’s quick walk land, quick change of scenery. Well that's all! And now there were lions, fifteen feet away from us, so real, so feverish and startlingly real, that you could feel the fur tingling on your arm, and your mouth was filled with the dusty upholstery smell of their hot skins and the yellow of them was in your eyes like a refined yellow French tapestry, yellow lions and summer grass, the noise of light lion lions wafting on a quiet afternoon, and the smell of meat from suffocating dripping mouths. The lions stood looking at George and Lydia Hadley with scary green-yellow eyes.
"Caution!" screamed Lydia.
The lions ran to them.
Lydia escaped and ran. Instinctively, George jumped after her. Outside, in the hall, with the door slammed, he laughed, and she cried, and they were both shocked by the reaction of the other.
"George!"
"Lydia! Oh my dear poor dear sweet Lydia!"
"They almost got us!"
“Walls, Lydia, remember; Crystal walls are all that they are. Oh, they look real, I have to admit - Africa is in your salon - but it is a glass, superreaction, ultra-sensitive color film and a film for mental tapes behind glass screens. smell and sound, Lydia. Here is my handkerchief. "
"I'm afraid." She went up to him and pressed her body against him and constantly cried. "Have you seen? Did you feel This is too real. ”
"Now, Lydia ..."
“You have to tell Wendy and Peter not to read about Africa anymore.”
"Of course of course." He patted her.
"Promise?"
"Sure."
"And lock the nursery for a few days until I get
